We chose the liscense because the liscense allows the use of our code in any way, while also protecting us legally. The liscense tells the user they may do anything with the code including selling, as we do not plan on making money or doing anyhting with this code, other than turning it in for a school project. Once the user edits it or uses it in any manner we are not legally responsible for what is done with it.

We created the code of conduct because we want this community to be an inclusive and respectful one. The code of conduct lists some encouraged and discouraged conducts. Contributers and users are expected to observe this code of conduct.
